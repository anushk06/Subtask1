Hello, myself Anushk Singhal from Kota(Rajasthan)
Roll Number - 220102012
Brach - ECE
Brahmaputra Hostel

I started learning Git and Github after the release of coding week resources only, hoping to get a good understanding of Open Source.

Why I want to contribute to Open Source ?
I think open source provides me an opportunity to implement those technologies which I've learnt on some big project.
Moreover open source is a great way for even me to invite valuable suggestions and bug fixes on my very own project.
