Hello, myself Anushk Singhal from Kota(Rajasthan)
Roll Number - 220102012
Brach - ECE
Brahmaputra Hostel

I started learning Git and Github after the release of coding week resources only, hoping to get a good understanding of Open Source.

Why I want to contribute to open source
I thunk Open Source provides me an opprtunity to implement those technologies which I've learnt, on some bigger projects.
Moreover open source is a great way for even us to invite valuable suggestions and bug fixes on our own project.
